Ever wanted Discord on a terminal? Get TermCord, the easy-to-use terminal "app" made to make your life a little bit easier. With it being light-weight and fast, it can connect in seconds! Most of all, it even supports user tokens, aswell as bot tokens!

## Install
- Click [here](https://github.com/sharknix/TermCord/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and save the ``TermCord-master.zip`` file included.
- Extract it, and "``cd``" over to the TermCord folder
- And finally, run it using the command ``start welcome.bat``, or(optional) make a shortcut linking to the ``welcome.bat`` file, then open/run the shortcut.

## Usage
Put in a user/bot token, and your in!
Just use it like normal discord. Chat and talk with friends, and more :smile:
